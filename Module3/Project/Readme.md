###Getting and cleaning data course
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

This repository folder contains the project for the 3rd module 'Getting and cleaning data'
the following files can be found inside this folder.

* [run_analysis.R] the code file for the project file
* [cleansummary1.txt] the results of the project.
* [Codebook.MD] the codebook relating to clean summary 1.

### Data treatment process 
the raw data was adapted from the data set at [rawdatalink]. this originally included 561 individual measures
this project breaks down the data contained into a more interpretable format the process is described more in the codebook

### Output dataset
the output data set can be recreated given the correct working directory and files downloaded and extracted at the
relevant route then run_analysis.R script will output a cleaned data set.
